Flutter website availability checker

This is test project, where I try to use two design patterns for state management:
1. Provider
2. Bloc

Also in this project you can find a lot of interesting things like:
1. Work with Sql - create / read / delete (check for duplication in insert)
2. Make http request
3. Url validation with regular expression
4. Logical elements (screens, widgets, blocs and etc) in separate files
